# UnitFix 🛠️

UnitFix is a lightweight maintenance coordination platform built for landlords and property managers who want a simple, reliable way to manage maintenance requests, assign contractors, and track progress — without spreadsheets, texts, or endless email chains.

## Problem

Maintenance coordination is one of the biggest operational pain points in property management:
- Requests come in via texts, calls, and emails
- Contractors miss details or updates
- Landlords have no single source of truth
- Status tracking becomes manual and error-prone

UnitFix solves this by centralizing everything into one clean, easy-to-use system.

## Solution

UnitFix allows landlords to:
- Receive maintenance requests in one place
- Assign requests to contractors
- Track request status from start to finish
- Reduce back-and-forth communication

All without complex setup or bloated features.
